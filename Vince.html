    <h1>Info About Vince Mchanon</h1>

        <strong>Vincent Kennedy McMahon; born August 24, 1945) is an American media proprietor and retired professional wrestling promoter, executive, and performer. From 1982 to 2022, he served as the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of WWE, the world's largest professional wrestling company, of which he is still majority owner and wields the majority of voting power. He is also the founder and owner of Alpha Entertainment. </strong>

        <strong>Born in Pinehurst, North Carolina, McMahon graduated from East Carolina University with a degree in business in 1968 and began his tenure in professional wrestling as a commentator for the then-World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) for most of the 1970s; McMahon bought the company from his father, Vincent J. McMahon, in 1982 and almost monopolized the industry, which previously operated as separate entities across the United States. This led to the development of the annual WrestleMania, which became one of the most successful professional wrestling events. WWE faced industry competition from World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the 1990s, before purchasing the competing company in 2001. WWE also purchased the assets of the defunct Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 2003. </strong>

        <strong>McMahon has embarked on a number of WWE-related ventures. In 2014, he launched the WWE Network, a subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service. McMahon also owns other WWE multimedia subsidiaries and a professional wrestling training facility. Outside of wrestling, McMahon joint-owned and operated the XFL, a football league, twice; both iterations folded after a single season, with the second due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He also headed the short-lived World Bodybuilding Federation and co-owns the clothing brand Tapout. </strong>

        <strong>McMahon has appeared on-screen for WWE since 1969, initially as a personable, play-by-play commentator. From 1997, McMahon adopted the gimmick of Mr. McMahon, playing an irascible, villainous, swaggering tyrant who obsessed over maintaining control of his company, growling the catch phrase "You'rrre firrred!!!"[3] Under the Mr. McMahon gimmick, he occasionally competed in professional wrestling matches and became a one time WWE Champion, a one time ECW Champion, a Royal Rumble match winner, and a multi-time pay-per-view headliner. </strong>
